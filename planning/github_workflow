Set up
- initialize local repo (git init)
- set up remote connection (git remote set-url origin git@github.com:renzosj/debug-thugs-project-2.git)
- Pull in main branch (git pull origin main)


Workflow
- run git status anytime
- run git pull origin main on main branch
  - keep up to date on feature branches + any changes
- On CLI, git checkout into working branch before making any changes (e.g. git checkout feature/some-feature) NOT main branch
- make changes on local files
- stage changes (git add -A)
- commit changes + message (git commit -m "message here")
- push changes to remote branch (git push origin feature/some-feature)
- Make a Pull Request on github repo
  - Get changes approved
  - Merge branches
- After confirming branch merge, checkout to main (git checkout main)
- run git pull to finish workflow (git pull origin main)
- Do it again!


What if somebody made changes and I'm still working on a branch?
- Time to stash! run (git stash) while working on your branch
- git checkout main
- git pull origin main (update local repo with the new changes from remote)
- git checkout [branch_name] (return to what you were working on!)
- git stash pop (bring back your changes)
